## 🎯 Learning Goals

- ✅ Master user input and output operations
- ✅ Understand control flow (if-else statements, loops)
- ✅ Work with Python standard library modules
- ✅ Build interactive console applications
- ✅ Learn probability and statistics through simulation
- ✅ Practice problem-solving with real-world scenarios

## 📝 Script Details

### 🎲 randomCoinFlip.py
Simulates 10,000 experiments of flipping a coin 100 times to determine the probability of getting a streak of 6 consecutive heads or tails. This demonstrates:
- Random number generation
- List manipulation
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern recognition in data

### 🪨📄✂️ rpsGame.py
Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer with persistent score tracking.

### 🎯 TheNumber.py
A guessing game where you have limited attempts to guess a randomly chosen number.

## 🛠️ Tips for Learning

1. **Read the code** - Start by understanding what each line does
2. **Modify and experiment** - Change values, add features, break things!
3. **Debug actively** - Use print statements to understand program flow
4. **Build upon these** - Use these scripts as templates for your own projects
