# Machine Learning Python Scripts

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts for learning programming concepts and practicing basic coding skills. Each script demonstrates a different aspect of Python, from user input and control flow to simple games.


## Contents

- **Introduction.py**
  - Demonstrates basic input/output, string manipulation, if-else statements, and loops.
- **Modules.py**
  - Shows how to use Python modules (like `sys`) and create a simple command loop that exits on user command.
- **rpsGame.py**
  - A Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you play against the computer. Tracks wins, losses, and ties.
- **TheNumber.py**
  - A "Guess the Number" game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment in the `env/` folder:
  - On Windows (cmd): `env\Scripts\activate`
  - On WSL/Linux/macOS: `source env/bin/activate`

3. Run any script using:

  ```bash
  python <scriptname>.py
  ```

## Learning Goals

- Practice with user input and output
- Understand control flow (if-else, loops)
- Work with Python modules
- Build simple interactive games
